# SilverBullet plug for saying hello to the user

A well behaved plug that will greet your users.

## Wait, SilverBullet?

If you don't know what it is, check its [webpage](https://silverbullet.md), but if
you want me to spoil the fun: it is an extensible note taking app with markdown and plain files at its core
(well... there is a bit of magic in there too, but what good it would be without a little magic?)

## Installation

Open (`cmd+k`) your `PLUGS` note in SilverBullet and add this plug to the list:

```yaml
- https://github.com/Willyfrog/silverbullet-plug-example/releases/download/v0.1/helloworld.plug.json
```

Then run the `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!

## What's with all that Lone Ranger quotes

Don't you know that the [Lone Ranger used silver bullets to solve all the problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet#Lone_Ranger)?
